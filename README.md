<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![GPTEverest Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://gpteverest.com/)

GPTEverest is a project created by [Jannis Thuemmig](https://twitter.com/thuemmig) and sponsored by [WP Webhooks](https://wp-webhooks.com).
It aims to bring the power of AI closer to WordPress, allowing everyone to visually interact with their website.
Please keep in mind that this project is in `BETA` and should be used with care as the assistant has acces to the database, WordPress functions, and PHP functions.

While the general structure is there, it needs some training and refinements to properly answer critical questions more precise. Please use with caution.
